# Prosthetics for the people of Gaza

Since October 2023, Gaza has been subject to a brutal bombing campaign where thousands have lost their lives. But, the damage extends beyond that where thousands have lost their limbs. In order for the people of Gaza to heal, they require prosthetics. Due to the amount of people who require prosthetics, we will need to source prosthetics at a low cost to maximize the impact we can make. This project concerns a way to source, manufacture and distribute prosthetics at a low cost to the children of Gaza.

# Plan

The things related to prosthetics that we're targeting are:

- take a 3-d scan of the affected limb.
- design a custom fit prosthetic per person

## 3-D Scan 


## Custom Fit Low Cost Prosthetics
